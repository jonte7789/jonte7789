<h5>Hi, I'm Jonte, a computer science student with a passion for technology, I am eager to continue learning and gaining practical experience in the field. I am grateful to have received two scholarships, Go Waitaha Canterbury Scholarship and UC Hiranga Scholarship. I have also had the opportunity to work at J H Whittaker & Sons as a quality intern for 8 weeks, where I was able to build up many important skills. I am excited to continue growing my skills and making meaningful contributions in the IT industry.
